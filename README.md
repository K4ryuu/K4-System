### Dependencies

To use this server addon, you'll need the following dependencies installed:

- **MySQL Database (Version 5.2 or higher):** This project requires a MySQL database to store and manage data. You can host your own MySQL server or use a third-party hosting service. Make sure it's at least version 5.2 or higher.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A working CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) server.
- CounterStrikeSharp is up to date and is running on your server.
- A compatible MySQL database (Version 5.2 or higher) set up and configured.
